# run our diffusion model (iterative difference equation) with initial concentration of 10, for 8 timestep (size 1m), and 10 space steps (size 1s)
# using diffusion parameters 0.5 s/m2, 10 m2

# or if you prefer this orientation (Distance on x axis)

# Change parameters (diffusivity D, and space and time steps (dx, dt))

```{r}
# changes diffusivity and other parameters particularly
# diffusivity, dx and dt

# we can also see how much material moved from place to place each time step

# play with time step, space step and parameters
